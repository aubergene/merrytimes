Holocenter Install Plan
=========
##IDEAS 
*   ships to/from governor's island; pacing of the ships moves projection objects; audio input influenced by attendance/audience and their interaction with the interior environment

###MERRYTIMES

Previously, travel to island locales has depended on modes of maritime transportation; contemporary connectivity relies moreso on modes of communication (network activity, simple syndication) as forms of transporation to insular environments. We can navigate to Governor's Island without physical displacement, however the alternative of actual movement is still possible. Merry-times comments on this contemporary phenomenon of circumstantial telepresence, honoring visitor traffic past and present.

Our installation combines historical and contemporary modes of movement, visualizing and auralizing networked traffic between islands and internet zones. Parallax projections visualize real-time ferry traffic as moving imagery in a maritime-military decopage motif; meanwhile, ambient sounds synced to audience network activity as attendees enter and exit provide a sense of dual parallax and human presence. When remote *distance* can collapse into *instants* of interconnectivity; our understanding of temporal and spacial insularity warps; Merrytimes invites viewers to interact with, and immerse themselves in this sense of simultaneous position, presence, and parallax displacement.

 
## STYLE
* rough cutout aesthetic
* contemoproary 
* evocative of Peter Blake's and maritime military decopage style

## TECH SPECS
We will provide a laptop with projection-worthy web-view; we'll also have an accompanying web-version of the installation.
We will require two projectors.
