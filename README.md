# merrytimes

merrytimes visualization for governor's island holocenter install

## How to build

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt --debug
```

## Guidelines
* images (historical) swell and move according to ship rate
* save imgs as pngs in publi/img folder (lowcase, hyphens)
* will batch process at B/W in css
* background parallax will be either panorama of island view or flattened silhouette
* OBJECTIVE: build a pictorial clock (something that shows how network activity and travel are relative to your postion...in this case, a tempo/spatial warp in an island interior)

# Prep
##Questions for Visit
* Does the venue have wifi? How many outlets are there?
* What resolution is the projector? How many projectors do we have (same make/model?)?
* Access to historical assets or resources, any recommendations? Special pass to "tunnel"?
* What will the audience be like for the duration of our residency?
* How long will the application be "up" (both duration of the residency and runtime of the app)?
* How much of our own hardware will we have to provide (computer? macmini?)?
* Do we need to make title/artist labels? What can we mount/paste/attach to the walls?
* Is there anyone available when we install to help with technical/insfrastructure/mounting issues? Is there a ladder? Can we run cables?
* Can we be provided with pictures/CAD drawings?
* When is "take-down"? What is the general timeline?

**Consider the install atmosphere:**
* What is the light quality, take a look at how the projector displays something from the web if you can (how does it look versus something on your phone...will our projection be tinted?)? Will it run only daytime (full-light)
* What is the room layout (draw a sketch, take pictures)
* What image size are we shooting for?
* Will shadows be an issue, will the audience block projections at any point, if so, can we use this to our advantage?

## Questions Post-visit
* Visualize piece in the space and imagine issues that might pop
up (are you installing something with sound in a loud space, something
with a projector in a bright space, trying to interact with people who
do not want to interact with you, are there kids running around, etc.)
* Don't make any assumptions about who is responsible for anything; be prepared to do everything
* Can we set everything up so that this works

## Don't forget
* Take pictures of the space, measure if possible (even with feet, we can measure your foot and counts later if you don't have a tape measure)
* Try for a panorama image around the island
