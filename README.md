merrytimes visualization for governor's island holocenter install

## How to build

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt --debug
```

## Guidelines
* images (historical) swell and move according to ship rate
* save imgs as pngs in publi/img folder (lowcase, hyphens)
* will batch process at B/W in css
* background parallax will be either panorama of island view or flattened silhouette
* OBJECTIVE: build a pictorial clock (something that shows how network activity and travel are relative to your postion...in this case, a tempo/spatial warp in an island interior)


##Questions for Visit
* Does the venue have wifi?
* What resolution is the projector? How many projectors do we have (same make/model?)?
* Access to historical assets or resources, any recommendations? Special pass to "tunnel"?
* What will the audience be like for the duration of our residency?

##Questions Post-visit
* Visualize piece in the space and imagine issues that might pop
up (are you installing something with sound in a loud space, something
with a projector in a bright space, trying to interact with people who
do not want to interact with you, are there kids running around, etc.)
* Don't make any assumptions about who is responsible for anything; be prepared to do everything

##Don't forget
* take pictures of the space, measure if possible (even with feet, we can measure your foot and counts later if you don't have a tape measure)
* try for a panorama image around the island
