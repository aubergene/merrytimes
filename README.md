merrytimes visualization for governor's island holocenter install

## How to build

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt --debug
```

## Guidelines
* images (historical) swell and move according to ship rate
* save imgs as pngs in publi/img folder (lowcase, hyphens)
* will batch process at B/W in css
* background parallax will be either panorama of island view or flattened silhouette
* OBJECTIVE: build a pictorial clock (something that shows how network activity and travel are relative to your postion...in this case, a tempo/spatial warp in an island interior)


##Questions
* Does the venue have wifi?
* What resolution is the projector?
* Access to historical assets or resources? Special pass to "tunnel"?
*
